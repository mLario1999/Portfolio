# Automatic Bargain Hunting Application

This is a first-semester project made by a group at Aalborg University. The aim of the project is to develop a software application in the C programming language that facilitates automatic bargain hunting. The application will allow users to input a shopping list and search for the lowest total price of the items on the list at nearby stores. It uses simulated/custom data for demonstration purposes.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Bargain Hunting**: Allows users to input a shopping list and find the lowest total price of the items at nearby stores.
- **Simulated Data**: Uses custom or simulated store price data for demonstration purposes.
- **Command-Line Interface**: User-friendly command-line interface to interact with the application.

## Key Competences

- **Interacting with APIs (Networking)**: Ability to interact with external APIs to gather store data (if applicable in future extensions).
- **C Project Building**: Experience in structuring and building a C-based project, focusing on efficient memory management and performance.
- **Regex Parsing**: Utilized regular expressions for parsing input data and processing strings efficiently.

## Key Contributions

- **Regex Parsing**: Implemented regular expressions to handle and extract relevant data from user input and store data.
- **Command-Line UI**: Developed the command-line interface, enabling users to easily input their shopping lists and interact with the application.
